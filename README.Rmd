# levelnet

levelnet is, so far, an early-stage R package that can be used to analyse two-mode networks and
specifically their one-mode projection. The main purpose is to make several methods available that
extract the *binary backbone* of a one-mode projection. The best documented and tested method is
the *stochastic degree sequence model* (SDSM) by Z. Neal ([link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873314000343)). It also implements
the fairly unknown (but in the case of SDSM useful) scobit model.

The package still contains a lot of undocumented functions, which can be ignored for now.

## Installation

You can install the developers version of levelnet with:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("schochastics/levelnet")
```

## Example of `sdsm`

The package includes bill-cosponsorship data of the 115th Senate. Similar data was used in the
Paper by Neal an in [follow up work](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873317303039). The function `bipartite_from_data_frame` can be used to turn the data frame into 
a two-mode network (bipartite graph).

```{r example,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(igraph)
library(levelnet)
data("cosponsor_senate_15")
head(cosponsor_senate_15)

g <- bipartite_from_data_frame(cosponsor_senate_15,"name","bill")
```

The function `sdsm_diagnostic` checks the performance of several link functions.
The default optimization method for the MLE of the scobit model is "BFGS". ~~However,
I noticed that it often runs into convergence issues (like for this dataset). A more 
robust method is "Nelder-Mead" which is a little bit more time consuming. You may still run
into convergence problems. If so, try to adjust the parameter vector.~~

**Version 0.2.0 implements the gradients of the scobit function explicitly which facilitates the 
optimization**.  
```{r diagnostics,warning=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
params <- list(b0=1e-5,b1=1e-5,b2=1e-5,b3=1e-5,a=0.8)
sdsm_diagnostic(g,verbose=FALSE,params = params)
```

Note that there is no significant speed up for the scobit model to the previous version (runtime was ~50 sec).
The gradient function is rather complicated and needs to be evaluated many times during the
optimization process. This and the scobit function evaluation are the main bottleneck. 

As was noted in the paper, the scobit model produces the best fit of the data.

```{r fit,eval=FALSE}
params <- list(b0=1e-5,b1=1e-5,b2=1e-5,b3=1e-5,a=0.8)
l <- sdsm(g,proj = "true",model="scobit",params = params)
```
